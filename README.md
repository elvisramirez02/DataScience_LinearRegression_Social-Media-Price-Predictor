# 🚀 Social Media Price Predictor

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, I've combined web scraping, data science, and machine learning techniques to predict product prices based on social media metrics. My goal was to understand and quantify the relationship between social media engagement and product pricing, potentially revolutionizing pricing strategies in the digital marketplace.

## 🛠️ Technologies I Used

- Python
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)

## 🔍 My Approach

### 1. Web Scraping 🕷️

I extracted the following data points using BeautifulSoup:
- Date
- Price (my target variable)
- Likes
- Dislikes
- Followers


2. Data Preprocessing 🧹
I performed:

Feature engineering to create relevant predictors
Data transformation to prepare for modeling
Cleaning and handling of missing values

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📈
I conducted in-depth EDA to understand:

Distribution of prices and social media metrics
Correlation between social engagement and price
Trends and patterns that might influence pricing

4. Price Prediction Model 🤖
I implemented a Linear Regression model to predict prices based on social media metrics
-date 
-price 
-likes 
-dislikes
-followers


🌟 Potential Use Cases
My price prediction model, combining Marketing Analytics, Web Scraping, and Data Science, has several potential applications:

-Dynamic Pricing Strategies: Adjust product prices in real-time based on social media engagement.
-Influencer Campaign Valuation: Estimate the potential price impact of influencer partnerships.
-Product Launch Optimization: Predict optimal pricing for new products based on initial social media reception.
-Competitive Pricing Analysis: Compare predicted prices across different brands or markets.
-Social Media ROI Measurement: Quantify the impact of social media marketing on product value.

🚀 Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to:

Incorporate more advanced ML models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for potentially higher accuracy in price prediction
Add real-time data streaming for up-to-the-minute price predictions
Develop a user-friendly dashboard for easy visualization of predicted prices and influencing factors
